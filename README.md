# exon

Trying out Nextflow to manage the current pipeline.

data/ is sample data so should be runable on local machine.

For local run, use exonPipeline.nf and nextflow.config

For SLURM array job version, exon_nf.nf and exon_nf.config. (scripts are modified for the full data as now we can VST and compute 10PCs instead of no VST and 6PCs)
